This repository contains a simple IoT (Internet of Things) project that allows you to control electrical devices, such as room lamps, using a Raspberry Pi as the server and a Node-MCU ESP8266 microcontroller.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to provide remote control functionality for electrical devices. By following the steps below, you can set up and use this project.

## Instructions
To use this project, please follow these steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer. Download the required library :
- https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/
- https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
2. Program your Node-MCU ESP8266 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE by the code file.

3. Connect your server (Raspberry Pi) to a modem or router that use a static IP address.

4. Connect the microcontroller to the electrical devices or sensors that you want to control remotely (on/off functionality).

5. Edit the provided code with your own personal static IP address.

6. Install Node-RED on your Raspberry Pi and import the provided JSON file to set up the necessary flows.
